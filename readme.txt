running "compile.sh" compiles the program
running "benchmark-wce.sh <program-name>" i.e "benchmark-wce.sh ../cplex_with_reduction" script with program name in "wce-students" directory starts testing the program


cplex_with_reduction is cplex with reduction rules
cplex_without_reduction is cplex with out reduction rules
solver_non_optimal is solver with heuristics


*data sets need to copied into "wce-students" directory for "benchmark-wce.sh" script to work
