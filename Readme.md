# Instructions
- Running `compile.sh` compiles the program
- Running `benchmark-wce.sh <program-name>` i.e "benchmark-wce.sh ../solver_branching_2" script with program name in `wce-students` directory starts testing the program

- `Solver_branching_2` is the solver with new lower bound and new branching strategy

#### Note
- Data sets need to copied into `wce-students` directory for `benchmark-wce.sh` script to work
