# Instructions
- Running "compile.sh" compiles the program
- Running `benchmark-wce.sh <program-name>` i.e "benchmark-wce.sh ../solver_branching_2" script with program name in `wce-students` directory starts testing the program

- Solver_branching_2 is the solver with new lower bound and new branching strategy

Notes
- CPLEX installation on abc01 is causing issues with our program, we have copied our CPLEX installation to folder `/home/users/z/zia_badar/CPLEX_Studio201` on `abc01` and verified compile and running, please test on `abc01`
- Data sets need to copied into "wce-students" directory for "benchmark-wce.sh" script to work
