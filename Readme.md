# Instructions
- running "compile.sh" compiles the program
- running `benchmark-wce.sh <program-name>` i.e "benchmark-wce.sh ../solver_branching_2" script with program name in "wce-students" directory starts testing the program

- solver_branching_2 is the solver with new lower bound and new branching strategy

Notes:
Markup : * CPLEX installation on abc01 is causing issues with our program, we have copied our CPLEX installation to folder /home/users/z/zia_badar/CPLEX_Studio201 on abc01 and verified compile and running, please test on abc01 
               * Data sets need to copied into "wce-students" directory for "benchmark-wce.sh" script to work
